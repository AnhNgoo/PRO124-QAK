# Art Style

## General

The art style will be as close to the original as possible, with some small adjustments to keep the scope down. It might even reuse the existing artwork.

I will also try to get my nephew in somehow, maybe as the main character. Could maybe be done by modifying the original character.

### Original

## The remake

To keep the scope down this remake is only going to have the laboritory rooms included.

It could include some blinking lights, signs and desks/computers.

### Menu section

The first section is the menu part and where the player collects the jetpack. The resolution is 1920x1080.

### Endless section

The other section is the same image repeating endlessly. It's squared (1080x1080 or 1:1), and similar tiles can be created to randomize the background a bit.

# Technical Guidelines

## Software

- `Krita`
- `Aseprite`

## File Formats

- 2D assets: `.png`

## Restrictions

Keep the size of the files as small as possible.

One limitation is GitHub's size limit for single files: 100MB.

The base resolution is 1920x1080 (16:9), and all game assets that covers the whole screen should be in this size.

## Naming Conventions

As Godot's naming convention: [snake_case](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html#naming-conventions).


## Workflows

What are the workflows for creating any assets mentioned in this art bible?
